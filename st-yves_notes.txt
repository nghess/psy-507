what does the smoothness loss function do?

what does squared correlation coefficient with leak do?

joined = all areas
roi-wise = by area


todo:
confirm P is model prediction accuracy and that dots are voxels <- confirmed, Rho is model prediction and advantage/accuracy plot show voxel accuracy difference between models
visit each figure and confirm understanding/take notes
